# Vrinda-Store-Data-Cleaning-Sales-Analysis-in-Excel
## Project Overview
The Vrinda-Store project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a dirty dataset using Excel. The dataset contains various issues such as missing values, duplicate rows, inconsistent formatting, incorrect data types, outliers, and typographical errors. After cleaning the data, insightful analyses are performed to derive business insights and improve decision-making.

## Key Tasks
	• Handling missing values through imputation or removal.
	• Identifying and removing duplicate rows to maintain uniqueness.
	• Correcting inconsistent formatting (e.g., standardizing text case, date formats).
	• Ensuring correct data types for numerical, categorical, and date columns.
	• Detecting and addressing outliers that may impact data integrity.
	• Fixing typographical errors in text-based fields.
	• Adding new columns based on age groups for better data segmentation.
	• Dividing dates into separate columns (e.g., day, month, year) for better analysis.
	• Performing sales analysis to extract meaningful insights. 

## Sample Questions Answered
	• Compare the sales and orders using a single chart.
	• Which month had the highest sales and orders?
	• Who purchased more in 2022—men or women?
	• What are the different order statuses in 2022?
	• List the top 10 states contributing to sales.
	• Analyze the relation between age and gender based on the number of orders.
	• Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?
	• What is the highest selling category?

## Sample Insights
	• Women are more likely to buy compared to men (~65%).
	• Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 states contributing to sales (~35%).
	• The adult age group (30-49 years) contributes the most to sales (~50%).
	• Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra are the top sales channels (~80%).

## Final Conclusion to Improve Vrinda-Store Sales
	• To maximize sales, Vrinda-Store should:
	• Target women customers (30-49 years old) in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh.
	• Promote products through Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra by offering ads, discounts, and coupons.
