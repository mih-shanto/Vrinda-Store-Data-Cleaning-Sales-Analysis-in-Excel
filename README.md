# Excel -  Vprinda-Store-Data-Cleaning-Sales-Analysis
## Project Overview
The Vrinda-Store project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a dirty dataset using Excel. The dataset contains various issues such as missing values, duplicate rows, inconsistent formatting, incorrect data types, outliers, and typographical errors. After cleaning the data, insightful analyses are performed to derive business insights and improve decision-making.

	• Detecting and addressing outliers that may impact data integrity.
	• Fixing typographical errors in text-based fields.
	• Adding new columns based on age groups for better data segmentation.
