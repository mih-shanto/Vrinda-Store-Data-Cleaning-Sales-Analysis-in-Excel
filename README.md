# Vrinda-Store-Data-Cleaning-Sales-Analysis-in-Excel
## Project Overview
The Vrinda-Store project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a dirty dataset using Excel. The dataset contains various issues such as missing values, duplicate rows, inconsistent formatting, incorrect data types, outliers, and typographical errors. After cleaning the data, insightful analyses are performed to derive business insights and improve decision-making.

## Key Tasks
	• Handling missing values through imputation or removal.
	• Identifying and removing duplicate rows to maintain uniqueness.
	• Correcting inconsistent formatting (e.g., standardizing text case, date formats).
	• Ensuring correct data types for numerical, categorical, and date columns.
	• Detecting and addressing outliers that may impact data integrity.
	• Fixing typographical errors in text-based fields.
	• Adding new columns based on age groups for better data segmentation.
	• Dividing dates into separate columns (e.g., day, month, year) for better analysis.
	• Performing sales analysis to extract meaningful insights.
